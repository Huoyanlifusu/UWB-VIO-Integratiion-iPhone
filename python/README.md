# Overview

* Mainly some back-end data processing Python scripts as examples

## Requirement

* __Python__ 3.0 or above

## Directories

* __Environmental Analysis__ measures the localization error with ground truth between UWB and VIO localization data under different lighting conditions and visual textures
* __kalman__ designs a Kalman filter which is based on constant velocity motion model to integrate UWB and VIO localization data under condition that user shakes the iOS device

## Getting Started

* Download Python IDE such as __VSCode__
* Put table files and python script under same directory
* Using Python interpretor to run the script

## Experimental Evaluation
